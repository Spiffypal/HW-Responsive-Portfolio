# HW-Responsive-Portfolio

This project was to create a responsive website with links and photos using bootstrap.

The Images folder contains screenshots of the main index page.

The index page uses a navbar and 3 seperate columns at different sizes to display the content correctly.

The portfolio page uses a card style to displaythe content with a column length of 12 for the padding to the edge.

The contact for uses 3 seperate forms for text email and textbox.

The style.css file wasn't needed because of bootstrap. (it is not linked)

The page reforms to three different viewports and works on the a cell phone.

A sticky footer was added, but I am unsure how to get it to the bottom of the page...
